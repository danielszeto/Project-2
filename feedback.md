## Evaluation

Areas for improvement:

* Add wireframes to your readme
* I can't see your userstories as your trello board is private

Keep doing:

* Great project! Among other things, you got a working auth system, RESTful nested resources, photo uploads, and search.
* Nice job deploying
* Solid number of commits and good messages
* Site looks well thought out and designed

### Result: Exeeds Expectations
